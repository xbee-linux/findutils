  The Findutils package contains programs to find files. These programs are provided to recursively search through a directory tree and to create, maintain, and search a database (often faster than the recursive find, but is unreliable if the database has not been recently updated).
  Installed programs: find, locate, updatedb, and xargs
  Installed directory: /var/lib/locate
  Short Descriptions
    find: Searches given directory trees for files matching the specified criteria
    locate: Searches through a database of file names and reports the names that contain a given string or match a given pattern
    updatedb: Updates the locate database; it scans the entire file system (including other file systems that are currently mounted, unless told not to) and puts every file name it finds into the database
    xargs: Can be used to apply a given command to a list of files
